# Automate OS Installation Worker Setup

This Attune Project contains the Blueprints to setup a worker for 
the automate OS installation projects.

**What is a worker?**

The majority of the workload creating the ISO file(s) for the is 
performed on either the Attune host machine or a separate machine. 

The workload covers tasks such as unpacking ISO and repackaging with 
the drivers and configurations. This machine is referred too as the 
worker.

Attune Projects have been created to run with Windows, macOS, and 
Linux workers.
